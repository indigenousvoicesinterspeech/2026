                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
The languages spoken by First Nations people in Australia are as diverse as the landscapes of this continent. Primarily oral in nature, these languages are deeply connected to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander identities and cultures. However, English-speaking settler colonisation has had negative consequences for the health of these languages, and they tend to be overlooked in speech technology research.

                    </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                        This special session is dedicated to exploring the question: <b>What are roles of speech science and technology projects in advancing Indigenous cultural vitality and self-determination?</b>
                        These topics are under-represented by regular conference sessions, due both to the scarcity of Indigenous speech datasets, as well as the under-representation of Indigenous researchers in speech science and technology research.
                    </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
We recognise that Interspeech 2026 will take place on Gadigal Country, in the 5th year of the UN International Decade of Indigenous Languages.
                       This special session, <b>Indigenous Voices in Speech Science and Technology</b>, acknowledges the value of Country, language and culture to Indigenous peoples in Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples care for their Country using language which embeds deep traditional knowledge. Stories, ceremony and language are all deeply connected to place.
